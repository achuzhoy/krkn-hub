# kraken-hub

Hosts container images and wrapper for running scenarios supported by [Kraken](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken), a chaos testing tool for OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters to ensure it is resilient to failures. All we need to do is run the containers with the respective environment variables defined as supported by the scenarios without having to maintain and tweak files!


### Supported chaos scenarios

- [Pod Scenarios](docs/pod-scenarios.md)
- [Container Scenarios](docs/container-scenarios.md)
