# kraken-hub

Hosts container images for running scenarios supported by [Kraken](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken), a chaos testing tool for OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters to ensure it is resilient to failures. All we need to do is run the containers with the respective environment variables defined as supported by the scenarios!
